# The bug that defeated a dragon
As everyone knows Dragons are mythical creatures which do not exist
in nature. Not naturally, that is. 

It is a little known fact that in the year 1 AD, the wise
alchemist Lou Tan Dey-ta created a small batch
of dragons using unnatural means and a number of fizzy potions.
Those dragons still fly the skies today.

Dragons are extremely long lived and grow at a constant, but slow rate. 
Buying the right dragon saddle is a tricky business.

In order to help those lucky enough to one day ride on these dragons
Lou Tan published an algorithm for calculating the size of a saddle based
on the age of a Dragon. 

Centuries later this algorithm was hurriedly re-written in Java in
order to help those fortunate enough to require dragon saddles. The code leaves
a lot to be desired.


The Dragon Saddle Size Guesser has also become an unlikely party favourite!

Sadly, it now has a bug.
